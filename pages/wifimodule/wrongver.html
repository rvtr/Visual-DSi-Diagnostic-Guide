	<h3>Description</h3>
		The DSi immediately boots to "an error has occurred."
	<br><br>
		This can happen if the installed WiFi module and firmware are incompatible. 
	<h3>Solution</h3>
		If you have the DWM-W015 WiFi module, your issue is not caused by the WiFi module. The DWM-W015 version is compatible with all firmwares.
		<br><br>
		If you have the DWM-W024 or J27H020 WiFi modules, you will need to either replace them with a DWM-W015 or upgrade your firmware to v1.4 or higher. These boards are not compatible with anything prior to v1.4.
		<br><br>
		The WiFi module types are shown below. From top to bottom: DWM-W015, DWM-W024, J27H020
