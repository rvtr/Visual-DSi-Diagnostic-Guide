	<h3>Description</h3>
		The DSi boots to an error code such as "0000FEFE", or "0000FE00".
		<br><br>
		This happens when the NAND has been corrupted, or if it has broken (less likely).
	<h3>Solution</h3>
		Restore a NAND backup with ntrboot.<br><br>
		If you don't have a NAND backup, there is currently nothing to be done.
