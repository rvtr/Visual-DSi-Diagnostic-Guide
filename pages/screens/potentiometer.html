	<h3>Description</h3>
		One or more screens appear to be faded/washed out, or they are flickering.
		<br><br>
		This is because the potentiometers that control the screen brightness and contrast are improperly adjusted.
	<h3>Solution</h3>
		You will have to adjust the potentiometers (see photo below). Gently turn the potentiometers with a JIS B 1012 screwdriver until the screens look normal. If you do not have the right screwdriver, a Philips 00 will also work. You will have to be very careful though as the Philips screwdriver is slightly the wrong shape and can break the potentiometers.<br><br>
